flymake-css.el
==============

An Emacs flymake handler for syntax-checking CSS source code
using [`csslint`](https://github.com/stubbornella/csslint).

Installation
=============

If you choose not to use one of the convenient packages in
[Melpa][melpa] and [Marmalade][marmalade], you'll need to add the
directory containing `flymake-css.el` to your `load-path`, and then
`(require 'flymake-css)`. You'll also need to install
[flymake-easy](https://github.com/purcell/flymake-easy).

Usage
=====

Add the following to your emacs init file:

    (require 'flymake-css)
    (add-hook 'css-mode-hook 'flymake-css-load)

Beware that csslint is quite slow, so there can be a significant lag
between editing and the highlighting of resulting errors.
